My emacs settings
==================

These started from the [Peepcode "Meet Emacs"" video] (https://peepcode.com/products/meet-emacs/) which included the [Emacs Starter Kit] (https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/) by Phil Hagelberg.

In addition, the inimitable [Magnar Sveen] (https://github.com/magnars) of emacsrocks fame is a great resource.

To see an emacs master at work, [check out some of his emacsrocks videos] (http://emacsrocks.com) and of course his .emacs.d repo on github.
